Darpan
======
Darpan (refers to a mirror in Hindi) is a proposal to build a Nodejs/MongoDB stack based project to help organizations maintain people directory and facilitate HR.

### Objective
The objective is to build a web software to help an organization’s HR in managing and organizing people. HR should be able to manage contact information, reporting hierarchy, classify people, birthday and anniversary calendar, attendance/leave management, reports, etc. (Payroll is not the objective of this project yet)

### Requirements
The proposal is to support following use-cases in MVP:

1. At the time of installation HR shall be able to configure a domain so that only users with specific email address can register.
2. HR shall be able to configure company details like name, logo, admin email addresses, departments.
3. Self service: Users with email addresses (matching domain) should be able to register and complete their profiles.
4. Users shall be able to search by name and results will be displayed in card design. This way they can discover people and their contact information.
5. Users should be able to browse other users by department, should be able to create attendance sheet, etc.
6. HR shall be able to export this data in CSV or Excel format so that data can be consumed with other information systems.
7. User shall be able to register their plans for upcoming leaves.

** What will not be done **

1. Payroll management
2. Dynamic schema for user’s information. For any additional user fields, code changes are required.
